                <li>1 tablespoon green tea powder (matcha)</li>
                <li>2 teaspoons baking powder</li>
                <li>¼ teaspoon salt</li>
                <li>1 cup cashew milk</li>
                <li>1 tablespoon cashew milk</li>
                <li>1 large egg</li>
                <li>2 tablespoons olive oil</li>
                <li>2 teaspoons vanilla extract</li>

        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
                <li>
                <p><strong>Step 1</strong></p>
                <p>Whisk together flour, matcha, baking powder, and salt in a large bowl.</p>
                <p>Make a well in the center of mixture; add 1 cup plus 1 tablespoon cashew milk, egg, olive oil, and vanilla to the well.</p>
                <p>Whisk batter briefly until just a few small clumps of flour remain.</p>
                <p>Add chocolate chips; stir again briefly.</p>
            </li>

            <li>
                <p><strong>Step 2</strong></p>
                <p>Grease a small saucepan lightly; heat over medium-low heat.</p>
                <p>Transfer 2 to 3 spoonfuls batter onto the center of the pan, spreading batter with the back of the spoon.</p>
                <p>Cook until small bubbles rise to the surface and burst, about 1 minute.</p>
                <p>Flip and cook until the edges are lightly golden brown, about 1 minute more.</p>
                <p>Repeat with remaining batter.</p>
            </li>
